# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General

**Q: How do I save my progress?**
**A:** Use the "Slots" in the top right corner. Click an empty slot to save. Click a filled (green) slot to Overwrite (requires confirmation).

**Q: Does the app auto-save?**
**A:** No, but your work is persisted in the browser's local storage until you clear the cache. We recommend using slots frequently.

## Tools & Canvas

**Q: Why can't I drag walls?**
**A:** Walls must be **Selected** first. Click the wall once to see the blue handles, then drag the handles. If handles don't appear, check the "Lock Walls" setting in the toolbar.

**Q: My keyboard shortcuts aren't working (e.g., 'V' for Select).**
**A:** As of version `eddc536`, shortcuts use physical key codes (e.g., the key in the 'V' position). This works even if you are using a non-English keyboard layout.

**Q: How do I disconnect a cable?**
**A:** Select the cable segment and press `Delete`. You cannot "unplug" it by dragging; you must delete the cable object.

## Export & Import

**Q: My PDF export is blank?**
**A:** This can happen if the resolution (DPI) is too high for your browser's memory. Try lowering the DPI setting or selecting a smaller "Export Area".

**Q: Can I import a PDF floorplan?**
**A:** Yes. Use the Import panel. Note that imported PDFs are rasterized (turned into images) for performance. DXF files remain vector-based for snapping.
